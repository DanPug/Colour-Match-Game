# Color Match Game

## How to Play

1. Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. A colour name will appear in the center, displayed in a different colour to the name.
3. Click on one of the surrounding colour boxes that matches the NAME of the colour displayed in the centre box.
4. You have a limited amount of time to make your decision; if you run out of time or click the wrong colour box, the game will end.
5. Correctly match 20 colours in a row to move on to the next level. Each level decreases the amount of time you have to select a box.
6. Complete level 5 to win the game.
